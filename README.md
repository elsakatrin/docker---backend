# docker---backend
This is the backend for guide 2 in module 5 


I followed Sm√°ris tutorial: https://faun.pub/the-pern-stack-with-docker-for-beginners-9fa76e574d82
I used docker to make the info i wanted to come up on the website, it was just a small test so nothing fancy - just to test out how this would work.
I watched this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGz9DS-aIeY&ab_channel=NetworkChuck video to get a better understanding of what Docker is and how it works.
